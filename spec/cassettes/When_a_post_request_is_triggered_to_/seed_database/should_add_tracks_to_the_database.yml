        I'm done hating myself for feeling

        never been one to ask for help\nIf I need a mountain moved, I''ll move it
        myself\nI ain''t the church pew regular, twice on Sunday\nQuote you the scripture
        kind\nI''m far from a preacher, but I''m a believer\n\n''Cause every single
        day before, I knew your name\nI couldn''t see your face, but I prayed for
        you\nEvery heartbreak trail when all hope failed\nOn the highway to hell,
        I prayed for you\nI kept my faith like that old King James said I''m supposed
        to\nIt''s hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom\nI didn''t know you
        from Adam, but I prayed for you\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial

        I've never been one to ask for help
        If I need a mountain moved, I'll move it myself
        I ain't the church pew regular, twice on Sunday
        Quote you the scripture kind
        I'm far from a preacher, but I'm a believer

        'Cause every single day before, I knew your name
        I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you
        Every heartbreak trail when all hope failed
        On the highway to hell, I prayed for you
        I kept my faith like that old King James said I'm supposed to
        It's hard to imagine, bigger than I could fathom
        I didn't know you from Adam, but I prayed for you

        My Lucifer is lonely

        Standing there, killing time
        Can't commit to anything but a crime
        Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
        Animals, evidence
        Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
        Once you get inside 'em
        Got friends but can't invite them

        Hills burn in California
        My turn to ignore ya
        Don't say I didn't warn ya

        All the good girls go to Hell
        'Cause even God herself has enemies

        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

        I'm not feelin' up, baby, I let him gas me (Yeah)

        Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
        Sit that cat on my lap, I give it good strokes
        I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
        Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
        She knows what the fuck is up, I ain't gotta dumb it down
        Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
        I love her, she's a freak

        I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week

        Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace

        Even if we both break down tonight
        And you say you hate me
        And we go to bed angry
        I know everything will be alright
        I'll be here waiting
        I promise I'm changing
        I just need

        A little time to show you I'm worth it
        I know that I can be a difficult person
        I'm a stress case drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
        Actually I'm probably worse when I'm not you don't deserve it
        Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
        Every time I do I say something that hurts you
        Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
        I don't like to be wrong which I know you relate to
        And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your road
        That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
        That's just the pride talkin' isn't it 'cause both of us know
        I'm the definition of wreck if you look into my soul
        Comes out the most
        When I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
        Made a lot of mistakes
        I wish I knew how to erase
        When I'm afraid
        Might get distant, and I push you away

        I promise that you'll never find another like me
        I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
        I know I never think before I jump
        And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
        I know that I went psycho on the phone
        I never leave well enough alone
        And trouble's gonna follow where I go
        (And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

        But one of these things is not like the others
        Like a rainbow with all of the colors
        Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
        I promise that you'll never find another like

        ¿Qué pasó contigo?
        ¡Dímelo! (Rrr)
        O-O-Ovy On The Drums (Mmh)

        Ya no tiene excusa
        Hoy salió con su amiga
        Dice que pa' matar la tusa

        Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
        Está dura y abusa
        Se cansó de ser buena
        Ahora es ella quien los usa

        Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
        Ya no se le ve sentimental
        Dice que por otro man no llora, no

        Pero si le ponen la canción
        Le da una depresión tonta
        Llorando lo comienza a llamar
        Pero él la dejó en buzón
        Será porque con otra está
        Creyendo que a otra se puede amar

        Pero dice que ahora este llanto por nada

        Oh, she's sweet but a psycho

        Oh, she's hot but a psycho
        So left but she's right though

        She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
        She'll rip your shirt within a second
        You'll be coming back, back for seconds
        With your plate, you just can't help it

        No, no you'll play along
        Let her lead you on, on, on
        You'll be saying, "No, no"
        Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes"
        'Cause she messin' with your head

        Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
        A little bit psycho
        At night she screamin'

        When they meet their 400 pound mate
        If I could rule the world, everyone would have a gun
        In the ghetto of course, when giddyupin' on their horse
        I kick a rhyme drinkin' moonshine
        I pour a sip on the concrete, for the deceased
        But no don't weep, Wyclef's in a state of sleep
        Thinkin' 'bout the robbery, that I did last week
        Money in the bag, banker looked like a drag
        I want to play with pelicans from here to Baghdad
        Gun blast, think fast, I think I'm hit
        My girl pinched my hips to see if I still exist
        I think not, I'll send a letter to my friends
        A born again hooligan only to be king again

        Ready or not, here I come
        You can't hide
        Gonna find you

        Hello darkness, my old friend
        I've come to talk with you again
        Because a vision softly creeping
        Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        And the vision that was planted in my brain
        Still remains
        Within the sound of silence

        In restless dreams I walked alone
        Narrow streets of cobblestone
        'Neath the halo of a street lamp
        I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
