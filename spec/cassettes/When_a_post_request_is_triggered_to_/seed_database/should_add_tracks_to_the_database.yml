        a monster (Yeah)\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\nI look like
        a villain outta those blockbusters\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\nBlood
        on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\nBlood
        on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\n\nI''m just a product of Slick

        Ugh, you're a monster

        I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
        Better hit the deck like the card dealer
        My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party
        A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby
        The Brain Heenan which is probably the
        Same reason I wrestle with mania
        Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
        Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
        If they sleepin' on me, the
        Hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, hydroxycut
        Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)

        In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
        Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday
        This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, h-a, h-a, h-a
        Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames
        They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)

        Monster
        You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
        I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)
        When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
        I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
        Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
        Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
        Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
        Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

        I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
        Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off
        It's impossible to list 'em all
        And in the midst of all this
        I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
        Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
        Risperdal, voices whisper

        But my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
        This is just the song to go ballistic on

        Since when has impossible
        Ever stopped You?

        This is the sound
        Of dry bones rattling
        This is the praise
        Make a dead man walk again

        Open the grave
        I'm coming out
        I'm gonna live
        Gonna live again
        This is the sound
        Of dry bones rattling!

        Pentecostal fire
        Stirring something new
        You're not gonna run out of miracles
        Anytime soon

        Resurrection power
        Runs in my veins too
        I believe there's another miracle
        Here in this room!

        This is the sound
        Of dry bones rattling
        This is the praise
        Make a dead man walk again

        Open the grave
        I'm coming out
        I'm gonna live
        Gonna live again
        This is the sound
        Of dry bones rattling! Yeah!

        My God is able to save
        And deliver and heal
        And restore anything that He wants to
        Just ask the man
        Who was thrown
        On the bones of Elisha

        Hello darkness, my old friend
        I've come to talk with you again
        Because a vision softly creeping
        Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        And the vision that was planted in my brain
        Still remains
        Within the sound of silence

        In restless dreams I walked alone
        Narrow streets of cobblestone
        'Neath the halo of a street lamp
        I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light

        I remember that first time I fell in love
        I've never been the one to be afraid to jump
        And sometimes it hurts
        But the world still turns
        I remember that first sad broken heart

        And I told myself I wouldn't fall apart
        So I let it burn
        That's how you live and learn
        It ain't always easy
        But it's gonna be alright

        It used to be me
        Hidin' insecurities
        With a cigarette and a bottle of whiskey
        I was the girl at home
        In the dark, all alone
        Sayin', "Why the hell doesn't he miss me?"

        We act so tough like it ain't nothin'

        I've got nothing to hide no more

        I've loved and I've hurt
        I've broken people down with words
        More grace than I deserve, for sure

        Known to be crazy, known to be wild
        Mama had herself a little devilish child
        Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door (at my door)

        I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
        Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
        Been every kind of lost that you can't find
        But I got one thing right

        Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
        Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
        'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
        But I got one thing right, you

        (Baby, I got one thing right, mmm)
        (Baby, I got one thing right)
        I got you

        You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
        You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play
        I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
        Just me and you and you and me alone

        We're just playing hide and seek
        It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
        I don't want to play no games
        I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you

        I don't give a fuck about you anyways
        Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?
        You never share your toys or communicate
        I guess I'm just a play date to you

        You built a wall.
