        Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold
        I can sense you there
        Like a friend I've always known
        I'm arriving
        And it feels like I am home

        I have always been a fortress
        Hold secrets deep inside
        You have secrets, too
        But you don't have to hide

        Show yourself
        I'm dying to meet you
        Show yourself
        It's your turn
        Are you the one I've been looking for

        All of my life?
        Show yourself
        I'm ready to learn

        Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

        How did we get here?
        All castaway on a lonely shore
        I can see in your eyes, dear
        It's hard to take for a moment more
        We've got to
        Burn the ships, cut the ties, send a flare into the night
        Say a prayer, turn the tide, dry your tears and wave goodbye

        Step into a new day
        We can rise up from the dust and walk away
        We can dance upon the heartache, yeah
        So light a match, leave the past, burn the ships
        And don't you look back

        Don't let it arrest you
        This fear is fear of fallin' again
        And if you need a refuge

        I'm done hating myself for feeling

        Love to you is just a game
        Look what I have done now
        Dialling up the numbers on you

        All around me are familiar faces
        Worn out places, worn out faces
        Bright and early for the daily races
        Going nowhere, going nowhere

        Their tears are filling up their glasses
        No expression, no expression
        Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
        No tomorrow, no tomorrow

        And I find it kind of funny

        ¿Qué pasó contigo?
        ¡Dímelo! (Rrr)
        O-O-Ovy On The Drums (Mmh)

        Ya no tiene excusa
        Hoy salió con su amiga
        Dice que pa' matar la tusa

        Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
        Está dura y abusa
        Se cansó de ser buena
        Ahora es ella quien los usa

        Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
        Ya no se le ve sentimental
        Dice que por otro man no llora, no

        Pero si le ponen la canción
        Le da una depresión tonta
        Llorando lo comienza a llamar
        Pero él la dejó en buzón
        Será porque con otra está
        Creyendo que a otra se puede amar

        Pero dice que ahora este llanto por nada
        Ahora soy una chica mala

        awake while the world is sound asleep and\nToo afraid of what might show up
        while you''re dreaming\nNobody, nobody, nobody sees you\nNobody, nobody would
        believe you\nEvery day you try to pick up all the pieces\nAll the memories,
        they somehow never leave you\nNobody, nobody, nobody sees you\nNobody, nobody
        would believe you\n\nGod only knows what you''ve been through\nGod only knows
        what they say about you\nGod only knows how it''s killing you\nBut there''s
        a kind of love that God only knows\nGod only knows what you''ve been through\nGod
        only knows what they say about you\nBut God only knows the real you\nThere''s
        a kind of love that God only knows\n\nThere''s a kind of love that\nThere''s
        a kind of love\n\nYou keep a cover over every single secret\nSo afraid if
        someone saw them they would leave\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial

        Wide awake while the world is sound asleep and
        Too afraid of what might show up while you're dreaming
        Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
        Nobody, nobody would believe you
        Every day you try to pick up all the pieces
        All the memories, they somehow never leave you
        Nobody, nobody, nobody sees you
        Nobody, nobody would believe you

        God only knows what you've been through
        God only knows what they say about you
        God only knows how it's killing you
        But there's a kind of love that God only knows
        God only knows what you've been through
        God only knows what they say about you
        But God only knows the real you
        There's a kind of love that God only knows

        There's a kind of love that
        There's a kind of love

        You keep a cover over every single secret
        So afraid if someone saw them they would leave

        Got a gipsy soul, I'm a rebel and rouge
        And I'm always on the run
        With a fire inside I ain't ever gonna die
        I'm a locked and loaded gun
        When the matches strike and the gasoline lights
        It's only just began
        One thing I learned is you can watch it all burn
        But the flame ain't ever done

        Raise 'em up a little higher, your lighters
        Outlaws and outsiders

        Some call me a renegade, the enemy
        Throw your hands up if you feel the same
        Whoa, living life at the edge
        Just say what you wanna say, or walk away

        Ooh, ooh
        Ha, yeah
        Hmm yeah, psycho

        널 어쩌면 좋을까
        이런 맘은 또 첨이라
        Up and down 이 좀 심해
        조절이 자꾸 잘 안돼
        하나 확실한 건
        I don't play the game

        우리 진짜 별나대
        그냥 내가 너무 좋아해
        넌 그걸 너무 잘 알고
        날 쥐락펴락해
        나도 마찬가지인걸 (Oh-oh-oh)

        우린 참 별나고 이상한 사이야
        서로를 부서지게 (부서지게)
        그리곤 또 껴안아 (그리곤 또 껴안아)

        You got me feeling like a psycho, psycho
        우릴 보고 말해 자꾸 자꾸
        다시 안 볼 듯 싸우다가도
        붙어 다니니 말야
        이해가 안 간대
        웃기지도 않대

        맞아 psycho, psycho (Psycho, psycho)
        서로 좋아 죽는 바보 바보 (바보, 바보)
        너 없인 어지럽고 슬퍼져
