        Why don't you take what you want from me?
        Take what you need from me
        Take what you want and go

        I never needed anything from you
        And all I ever asked was for the truth
        You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
        Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
        Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
        Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
        Like a plague, I was wasting away
        Tryna find my way out, find my way out

        And it finally came the day
        I start giving my heart away

        Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
        Wooh

        I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
        Even when I'm crying crazy
        Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
        Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
        You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
        Help you with your career, just a little
        You're supposed to hold me down
        But you're holding me back
        And that's the sound of me not calling you back

        Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
        Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
        Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
        Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
        Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
        New man on the Minnesota Vikings
        Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
        Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

        She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
        Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
        I saw you lookin' from across the way
        And now I really wanna know your name

        She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
        Man, you know that she drives me crazy
        The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
        You know I love watching you do your thing

        I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
        "Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
        I kiss her, this love is like a dream

        So join me in this bed that I'm in
        And push up on me and sweat, darling
        So I'm gonna put my time in
        I won't stop until the angels sing

        Jump in that water, be free
        Come South of the border with me
        Jump in that water, be free
        Come South of the border with me

        He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
        That he really wants to know my name, hey
        I saw you lookin' from across the way
        And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay

        Ven para acá quiero bailar, toma mi mano
        Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mi, estás temblando

        Hold on, hold on
        Hold on, hold on

        시린 겨울바람
        깊은 발자국 아래 홀로 피어나
        내가 태어나고
        널 만난 이유를 찾아서 헤매어

        하얗게 번지는 한숨은
        얼어붙은 눈물
        버려진 꿈들은 다른 상처를 낳고
        이 계절의 끝이 어딜까
        영원이 있다면
        Hold on, hold on, hold on

        I will take it away before you stumble (Hold on, hold on)
        I will stay by your side until you survive (Hold on, hold on)
        피어나 주기를

        난 왜 널 만난 걸까
        하필 바로 지금 여기 이 겨울날
        눈 감으면 봄은 아득하고

        Some days, you're the only thing I know
        Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
        Can't look away, can't look away
        Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
        Sometimes, you're a stranger in my bed
        Don't know if you love me or you want me dead
        Push me away, push me away
        Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah

        Call me in the morning to apologize
        Every little lie gives me butterflies
        Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
        Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive

        Fight so dirty, but your love so sweet
        Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
        Late night devil, put your hands on me
        And never, never, never ever let go
        Fight so dirty, but your love so sweet
        Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth

        I've been having dreams
        Jumping on a trampoline
        Flipping in the air
        I never land, just float there

        As I'm looking up
        Suddenly the sky erupts
        Flames alight the trees
        Spread to falling leaves
        Now they're right upon me

        Wait, if I'm on fire
        How am I so deep in love?
        When I dream of dying
        I never feel so loved

        Hey homecoming queen
        Why do you lie?
        When somebody's mean where do you hide?
        Do people assume you're always alright?
        Been so good at smiling most of your life

        Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
        Dancing with your best foot forward
        Does it get hard
        To have to play the part?
        Nobody's feeling sorry for you

        But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
        If you started showing what's under your skin
        What if you let them all in on the lie

        Right now
        I just need you to get real loose
        Get comfortable
        Grab your loved ones or grab your love partner
        And if you're by yourself no worries
        Just follow after me

        Gon' and do the two step then cowboy boogie
        Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
        Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
        Take it to the left now and dip with it
        Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
        Now lean back, put your hips in it
        (Whoo, whoo, whoo) let's have some fun

        To the left, to the left now (to the left, to the left)
        To the right to the right (to the right)
        Now take your left hand and put it on your side (put it on your side)
        Go on, roll your shoulders (roll your shoulders)
        Do the slip and slide (do the slip and slide)
        This next part's my favorite part 'cause it's time to shine

        Gon' and do the two step then cowboy boogie
        Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em

        You are not hidden
        There's never been a moment
        You were forgotten
        You are not hopeless
        Though you have been broken
        Your innocence stolen

        I hear you whisper underneath your breath
        I hear your SOS, your SOS

        I will send out an army to find you
        In the middle of the darkest night
        It's true, I will rescue you

        dear\nIt''s hard to take for a moment more\nWe''ve got to\nBurn the ships,
        cut the ties, send a flare into the night\nSay a prayer, turn the tide, dry
        your tears and wave goodbye\n\nStep into a new day\nWe can rise up from the
        dust and walk away\nWe can dance upon the heartache, yeah\nSo light a match,
        leave the past, burn the ships\nAnd don''t you look back\n\nDon''t let it
        arrest you\nThis fear is fear of fallin'' again\nAnd if you need a refuge\n...\n\n*******

        How did we get here?
        All castaway on a lonely shore
        I can see in your eyes, dear
