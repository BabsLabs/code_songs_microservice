        Here's to the ones that we got
        Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        Of everything we've been through
        Toast to the ones here today
        Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
        'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
        And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

        There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
        When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
        Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
        'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

        Everybody hurts sometimes
        Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
        But everything gon' be alright
        Go and raise a glass and say, ayy

        I, I hope she makes you smile
        The way it made me smile on the other end of a
        Phone in the middle of a highway driving alone
        Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
        That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about
        Her then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah

        I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
        I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
        I hope you never ever felt more
        Free, tell your friends that you're so happy
        I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
        I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
        I hope she's wilder than your wildest
        Dreams, she's everything you're ever gonna need

        And then I hope she cheats
        Like you did on me
        And then I hope she cheats
        Like you did on me

        깊은 발자국 아래 홀로 피어나

        We are, we are, we are

        L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
        Sundown and they all come out
        Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
        The party's on, so they're headin' downtown

        Everybody's lookin' for a come up
        And they wanna know what you're about
        Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
        We're just tryna figure everything out

        We don't fit in well
        'Cause we are just ourselves
        I could use some help
        Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

        You look stunning, dear
        So don't ask that question here
        This is my only fear, that we become (hey)
        Beautiful people

        Drop top, designer clothes
        Front row at fashion shows
        "What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
        Inside the world of beautiful people

        I count down 'til you call me
        It's just one of those things
        That you do when you're lonely
        And you're all about the chase
        But you won't ever let me catch you
        And I wish I was the same

        But I know I'm gonna let you win again and when I do
        It's gonna hurt like hell and you don't mean to
        That's what I tell myself

        But, why you gotta be so heartless?
        I know you think it's harmless
        You're tearing me apart and
        Girl the hardest part is
        You're so high on attention
        Taking miles from inches
        Leave me in the darkness
        Never finished what we started
        Girl why you gotta be so heartless?
        (So heartless, so heartless)
        Why you gotta be so heartless?

        You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
        I mean, it's like ever since Baby on Baby dropped
        Man, like, you know (Ever since Baby on Baby dropped)
        Ain't nobody drop shit (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
        Let's go, hah

        I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
        I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
        Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
        My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country

        I finish the show and I hop in it
        I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
        I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot)

        Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? (Huh?)
        What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga (Get the fuck)
        Tryna figure which deal I'ma take (Uh-huh)
        I woke up, couple mil' on my plate (Let's eat)

        I'm investing in real and estate (Uh-huh)
        I just went gave my mama a hundred (A hundred)
        Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you
        Hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money (Let's go)

        As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
        I'm a little bit different, they get it (They dig)
        Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
        Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions (Hah)

        No, she ain't get no DM from me (Bitch)

        I never land, just float there

        You are not hidden
        There's never been a moment
        You were forgotten
        You are not hopeless
        Though you have been broken
        Your innocence stolen

        I hear you whisper underneath your breath
        I hear your SOS, your SOS

        I will send out an army to find you
        In the middle of the darkest night

        Right outside of this one church town
        There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothing
        Got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
        This is God's country

        We pray for rain and thank Him when it's fallin'
        'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
        We put it back in a plate, I guess that's why they call it
        God's country

        I saw the light in a sunrise
        Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy river side
        Gettin' baptized in holy water and shine with the dogs runnin'
        Saved by the sound of the being found
        Dixie whistle in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound

        40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat\nCoke cans and BB guns, barbed wire

        together and probably always will\nLike a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday
        drives and time to kill\nWhat''s the point of this ol'' guitar if it ain''t
        got no strings?\nOr pourin'' your heart into a song that you ain''t gonna

        A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat

        One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

        Tay Keith, this too hard (Tay Keith, this too hard)

        Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

        I don't got a heart, but fuck it I'm paid
        Lil' A-B the body, he fresh out the cage
        I'm still the same nigga from minimum wage
        They tryna keep up, so they stalkin' my page
        They do what I say, they tryna get saved
        They line up for me like they coppin' the J's
        I told her get right, start acting your age, can't believe you tried it

        Bitch, you played
        Wanted a diamond choker, soon as our time was over
        Bitch, you played
        She wanna ride the Rover, told her her Uber was closer
        Bitch, you crazy
        She tried to show out in public, I cut the bitch off like it's nothin'
        Bitch, you played
        She must've thought I was stupid
        I knew she was fuckin' my cousin

        I don't got a cold, I'm sipping on Hi-Tech
        The Dusse, the yellow, I'm straight out the project
        The first nigga play with me, he got shot at
        A hunnid some shots flipped the car, that's a car wreck
        I really don't need to be speaking on it
        But fuck it, you know how it be when I get (what)
        High off the motherfucking medicals (up there)
        Get in the booth, and go federal (federal)

        Her day starts with a coffee

        Takes forever gettin' ready
        So she's never on time for anything

        When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes
        Well, it kinda scares me
        The way that she drives me wild
        And she drives me wild

        Beautiful, crazy

        Ain't afraid to take chances

        Yeah, she's crazy
