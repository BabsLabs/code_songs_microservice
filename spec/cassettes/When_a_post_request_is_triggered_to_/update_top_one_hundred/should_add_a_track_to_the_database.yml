        Oh, oh, oh-oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh
        Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

        We couldn't turn around
        'Til we were upside down
        I'll be the bad guy now
        But no, I ain't too proud

        I couldn't be there
        Even when I try
        You don't believe it
        We do this every time

        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm waiting on you again
        So I don't take the blame

        If you don't wanna see me

        Did a full one-eighty

        Thinking 'bout the way I was
        Did the heartbreak change me?
        Maybe
        But look at where I ended up

        I'm all good already
        So moved on, it's scary
        I'm not where you left me at all, so

        If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
        If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

        Don't show up
        Don't come out
        Don't start caring about me now
        Walk away, you know how
        Don't start caring about me now

        Oh, yeah

        I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
        You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
        Why don't you take what you want from me?
        Take what you need from me
        Take what you want and go
        Why don't you take what you want from me?
        Take what you need from me
        Take what you want and go

        I never needed anything from you
        And all I ever asked was for the truth
        You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
        Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you
        Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
        Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
        Like a plague, I was wasting away
        Tryna find my way out, find my way out

        And it finally came the day
        I start giving my heart away

        know I already knew?\n\nCouldn''t even see you through the smoke\nLooking
        back I probably should have known\nBut I just wanted to believe that you were
        out sleeping alone\n\nLoved me with your worst intentions\nDidn''t even stop
        to question\nEverytime you burned me down\nDon''t know how for a moment it
        felt like heaven\n\nLoved me with your worst intentions\nPainted us a happy
        ending\nEverytime you burned me down\nDon''t know how for a moment it felt
        like heaven\nAnd it''s so gut wrenching\nFalling in the wrong direction\n\n...\n\n*******

        I don't hate you
        No, I couldn't if I wanted to
        I just hate all the hurt that you put me through
        And that I blame myself for letting you
        Did you know I already knew?

        Couldn't even see you through the smoke
        Looking back I probably should have known
        But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleeping alone

        Loved me with your worst intentions
        Didn't even stop to question
        Everytime you burned me down
        Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven

        Loved me with your worst intentions
        Painted us a happy ending
        Everytime you burned me down
        Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven
        And it's so gut wrenching
        Falling in the wrong direction

        널 만난 이유를 찾아서 헤매어

        I will stay by your side until you survive (Hold on, hold on)

        난 왜 널 만난 걸까

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
        This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
        I need somebody to heal
        Somebody to know
        Somebody to have
        Somebody to hold
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

        Now the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here
        To get me through it all
        I let my guard down
        And then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
        This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

        Right now
        I just need you to get real loose
        Get comfortable
        Grab your loved ones or grab your love partner
        And if you're by yourself no worries
        Just follow after me

        Gon' and do the two step then cowboy boogie
        Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
        Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
        Take it to the left now and dip with it
        Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
        Now lean back, put your hips in it
        (Whoo, whoo, whoo) let's have some fun

        To the left, to the left now (to the left, to the left)
        To the right to the right (to the right)
        Now take your left hand and put it on your side (put it on your side)
        Go on, roll your shoulders (roll your shoulders)
        Do the slip and slide (do the slip and slide)
        This next part's my favorite part 'cause it's time to shine

        Gon' and do the two step then cowboy boogie
        Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em

        Used to spend my nights out in a bar room
        Liquor was the only love I've known
        But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
        And brought me back from being too far gone

        You're as smooth
        As Tennessee whiskey
        You're as sweet
        As strawberry wine
        You're as warm
        As a glass of brandy
        And honey, I stay stoned on your love
        All the time

        I've looked for love in all the same old places

        Hey homecoming queen
        Why do you lie?
        When somebody's mean where do you hide?
        Do people assume you're always alright?
        Been so good at smiling most of your life

        Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
        Dancing with your best foot forward
        Does it get hard
        To have to play the part?
        Nobody's feeling sorry for you

        But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
        If you started showing what's under your skin
        What if you let them all in on the lie

        I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
        But I was just kidding myself
        Our every moment, I start to replace
        'Cause now that they're gone
        All I hear are the words that I needed to say

        When you hurt under the surface
        Like troubled water running cold
        Well, time can heal but this won't

        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make your heartbeat better?
        If only I'd have known you were the storm to weather
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make it all stop hurting?

        Same old dive, same old end of the work week drink
        Bartender knows my name, but I don't mind
        She kicks 'em up strong, serves me up right

        And here I go again
        I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
        I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
        To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
        On that hardwood jukebox, lost in neon time
        My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
        And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
        I got my heartache medication

        Another girl, another dance to a country song
