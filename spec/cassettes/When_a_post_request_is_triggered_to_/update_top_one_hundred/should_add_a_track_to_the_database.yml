        I tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick ride
        Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
        Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
        She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
        Slide, slide in the Bentley trucker, the Wraith trucker
        Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her

        You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser

        Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops
        Pop that nigga with a hundred shots, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta

        Woo, woo
        I pull up like
        How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
        How you pull up? I pull up (woo, Seth in the kitchen)

        Let's go
        Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
        With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
        This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
        My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
        You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
        Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
        And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

        It's safe to say I earned it
        Ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
        Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay"
        Don't make me push the button
        Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket

        Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
        I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
        I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
        Just talked to my mama

        just for me\nAnd I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees\nI
        thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket\nAnd I called mama\n\n...\n\n*******

        You know there's a light that glows by the front door
        Don't forget the key's under the mat
        When childhood stars shine
        Always stay humble and kind

        Go to church 'cause your mamma says to
        Visit grandpa every chance that you can
        It won't be wasted time
        Always stay humble and kind

        Good, feeling good

        Ay, feeling good, like I should
        Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
        Feeling blessed, never stressed
        Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (yeah)

        Ay, everyday can be a better day despite the challenge
        All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
        It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance

        I don't wanna pass away
        I've been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
        I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
        I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect

        I've been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
        When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
        'Cause, yeah, we're still young, there's so much we haven't done
        Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son

        I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
        I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
        My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
        Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

        Don't stay away for too long

        Pressure, pushing down on me
        Pressing down on you, no man ask for
        Under pressure, that burns a building down
        Splits a family in two
        Puts people on streets

        That's okay

        It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
        Watching some good friends screaming let me out
        Pray tomorrow gets me higher
        Pressure on people, people on streets

        Okay

        Yeah, baby

        Out here ain't nothing but woods and water
        Drop a deer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
        Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
        How the good Lord intended it, yes he did

        I love my country
        I love my country
        Six strings and fiddles
        Whiskey from Kentucky

        We keep it funky
        We like how it sounds
        Monday to Sunday
        Yeah, I love my country

        I'm loud and proud
        Rolling into town
        Hanging out the window
        Like a blue tick hound

        Ain't sorry, ain't nothing to be sorry about
        I love my country and I love my country
        Up loud

        I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
        Had to love and lose a hundred million times
        Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
        Now I'm falling

        You say my name like I have never heard before
        I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
        I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
        Are you falling?

        Center of attention
        You know you can get whatever you want from me
        Whenever you want it, baby
        It's you in my reflection
        I'm afraid of all the things you could do to me
        If I would've known it, baby

        I would've stayed at home

        This shit's so good, should be illegal
        Need round two, I need a sequel
        Hit the backboard like a free throw
        You next level, you a cheat code
        In so deep, you hit my seafloor

        Got me singing like Alicia
        Got me using all your lingo
        Tell your girlfriend that you single
        Call me over 'cause I go hard

        Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
        Next day, act just like your road dog
        Bitches askin' how you know her
        Head game stupid, baby loca
        Too loud, callate la boca
        Out this world, you supernova
        Fuck that, I am coming over

        Can I come over?
        (Can) Can I (I) stop by (Stop by) to see you (See you) tonight?

        I can't wait to show you where I grew up
        Walk you around the foothills of my town
        Probably feel like you've been there before
        After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
        For six months now

        We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
        Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
        I'm not trying to scare you off but
        I just thought that we should talk a few things out
        Before we hit the road

        If I bring you home to mama
        I guess I'd better warn ya
        She falls in love a little faster than I do

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
        This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
        I need somebody to heal
        Somebody to know
        Somebody to have
        Somebody to hold
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

        Now the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here
        To get me through it all
        I let my guard down
        And then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
        This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

        How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?
        Leading you down into my core
        Where I've become so numb
        Without a soul
        My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
        Until you find it there and lead it back home

        (Wake me up)
        Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
        Wake me up inside (Save me)
        Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)

        Yeah, it's not a fucking phase, I just wanna feel okay, okay?

        Yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
        And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
        It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

        'Cause I'm about to break down, I'm searching for a way out
        I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I break down, falling into love now with falling apart
        I'm a popular, popular monster

        This that hot girl bummer anthem
        Turn it up and throw a tantrum
        This that throw up in your Birkin bag

        This that social awkward suicide
        That bite your lips and buy your likes
        I swear she had a man
        But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

        That college dropout music
        Every day leg day, she be too thick
        And my friends are all annoying
        But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
        This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded
        And the vodka came diluted
        One more line, I'm superhuman

        Flippin' through all these magazines

        I'm guilty 'bout everything that I eat (Every single day)
        Feelin' myself is a felony
        Jedi level sabotage

        I, me, myself and I don't see eye to eye
        Me, myself and I

        Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone?
        And I always got my finger on the self-destruct
        I wonder when I love me is enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
        I wonder when I love me is enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
