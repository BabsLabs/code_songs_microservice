        I tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick ride
        Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
        Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
        She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
        Slide, slide in the Bentley trucker, the Wraith trucker
        Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her
        As-salama-lama alaykum, you big hater
        You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser

        Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops
        Pop that nigga with a hundred shots, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
        DeDe made that nigga Diddy Bop, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha

        Woo, woo
        I pull up like
        How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
        How you pull up? I pull up (woo, Seth in the kitchen)

        Let's go
        Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
        With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
        This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
        My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
        You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
        Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
        And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

        It's safe to say I earned it
        Ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
        Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay"
        Don't make me push the button
        Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket

        Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
        I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
        I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
        Just talked to my mama

        Got a call from a friend about a friend
        It's news no one ever wants to hear
        It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
        He was just gettin' into his best years
        Yeah, something like that'll shake you up, wake you up

        So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
        Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
        Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
        And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
        I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
        And I called mama

        Good, feeling good

        Ay, feeling good, like I should
        Went and took a walk around the neighbourhood
        Feeling blessed, never stressed
        Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (yeah)

        Ay, everyday can be a better day despite the challenge
        All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
        It's gonna get difficult to stand but hold your balance
        I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

        E-e-everyone falls down sometimes

        We couldn't turn around
        'Til we were upside down
        I'll be the bad guy now
        But no, I ain't too proud

        I couldn't be there
        Even when I try
        You don't believe it
        We do this every time

        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm waiting on you again
        So I don't take the blame

        It's like
        Being on the outside of an inside joke
        It's like
        When they only got Pepsi and you really want Coke
        It's like
        Finally get a text back and it's just your mom
        It's like
        When you just broke up and they play your song

        I know I said it's kinda stupid
        But it's just the way I'm feeling right now
        And I hate that I could tell that song was probably on my shoes
        But now, right now
        I know she thinkin' now she found herself a winner
        I know you f*cked her on the counter
        Right before you cooked the dinner yeah
        I know you think about me when you kiss her
        I left a taste in your mouth
        Cause she tastes me now
        That you do out all our furniture and pictures
        I bet you sugarcoated truth
        I bet you real sweet with ya
        I know you think about me when you kiss her
        I left a taste in your mouth

        Standing there, starin' at that screen
        Was the first time you ever scared me

        God knows I don't know
        Exactly what I'm doin', but
        Good news, we got her to get through it

        I hope you look just like your momma
        And love her like I do
        You'll see close to perfect patience
        If you watch her every move
        You can always run to daddy
        You'll always be my baby, but
        Look at her, baby girl

        I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all

        Think you're so criminal

        Bruises on both my knees for you
        Don't say thank you or please
        I do what I want when I'm wanting to
        My soul, so cynical

        So you're a tough guy
        Like it really rough guy
        Just can't get enough guy
        Chest always so puffed guy
        I'm that bad type
        Make your mama sad type
        Make your girlfriend mad tight
        Might seduce your dad type

        But me, myself, I got nothing to prove

        You got a fast car
        And I got a plan to get us out of here
        I've been working at the convenience store
        Managed to save just a little bit of money
        We won't have to drive too far
        Just 'cross the border and into the city
        You and I can both get jobs
        And finally see what it means to be living

        You see, my old man's got a problem
        He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
        He says his body's too old for working
        I say, his body's too young to look like his
        My mama went off and left him
        She wanted more from life than he could give
        I said, somebody's got to take care of him

        That Arizona sky, burning in your eyes
        You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
        It's buried in my soul, like California gold
        You found the light in me that I couldn't find

        Walk you around the foothills of my town
        Probably feel like you've been there before
        After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
        For six months now

        We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
        Pack a shirt for church because we'll go
        I'm not trying to scare you off but
        I just thought that we should talk a few things out
        Before we hit the road

        If I bring you home to mama
        I guess I'd better warn ya
        She falls in love a little faster than I do

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
        This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
        I need somebody to heal
        Somebody to know
        Somebody to have
        Somebody to hold
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

        Now the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here
        To get me through it all
        I let my guard down
        And then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
        This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

        How can you see into my eyes, like open doors?
        Leading you down into my core
        Where I've become so numb
        Without a soul
        My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
        Until you find it there and lead it back home

        (Wake me up)
        Wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
        Wake me up inside (Save me)
        Call my name and save me from the dark (Wake me up)
        Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
        Before I come undone (Save me)
        Save me from the nothing I've become

        You can't just leave me

        Yeah, it's not a fucking phase, I just wanna feel okay, okay?

        Yeah, I struggle with this bullshit every day
        And it's probably 'cause my demons simultaneously rage
        It obliterates me, disintegrates me, annihilates me

        'Cause I'm about to break down, I'm searching for a way out
        I'm a liar, I'm a cheater, I'm a non-believer
        I'm a popular, popular monster
        I break down, falling into love now with falling apart

        Fuck you, and you, and you
        I hate your friends and they hate me, too
        I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
        This that hot girl bummer anthem
        Turn it up and throw a tantrum

        This that hot girl bummer anthem
        Turn it up and throw a tantrum
        This that throw up in your Birkin bag
        An' hook up with someone random
        This that social awkward suicide
        That bite your lips and buy your likes
        I swear she had a man
        But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

        That college dropout music
        Every day leg day, she be too thick
        And my friends are all annoying
        But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
        This that 10K on the table just so we can be secluded
        And the vodka came diluted
        One more line, I'm superhuman

        Fuck you, and you, and you
        I hate your friends and they hate me, too
        I'm through, I'm through, I'm through

        Oh, why do I compare myself to everyone?
        And I always got my finger on the self-destruct
        I wonder when I love me is enough (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
