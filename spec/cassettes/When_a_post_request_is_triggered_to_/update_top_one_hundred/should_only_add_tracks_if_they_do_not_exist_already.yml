        Woo child, tired of the bullshit
        Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
        Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
        In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
        Come now, come dry your eyes
        You know you a star, you can touch the sky
        I know that it's hard but you have to try

        If he don't love you anymore
        Just walk your fine ass out the door

        I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
        And I really wanna know, where you at, at?

        I was setback, where the stash at?
        Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)

        I, I hope she makes you smile
        The way it made me smile on the other end of a

        Oh baby I, I hope you hear a song
        That makes you sing along and gets you thinking about
        Her then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah

        I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
        I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
        I hope you never ever felt more
        Free, tell your friends that you're so happy
        I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
        I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
        I hope she's wilder than your wildest
        Dreams, she's everything you're ever gonna need

        And then I hope she cheats
        Like you did on me
        And then I hope she cheats

        It's all on me, it's my mistake
        I said "I don't love you" a little too late
        But I guess there ain't ever a right time
        And I don't know why it's called a goodbye

        Go run my name into the ground
        Tell everyone you know just how
        How I slammed the door on our forever
        But I promise you it's for the better

        I will stay by your side until you survive (Hold on, hold on)

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
        This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
        I need somebody to heal
        Somebody to know
        Somebody to have
        Somebody to hold
        It's easy to say, but it's never the same
        I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

        Now the day bleeds into nightfall
        And you're not here
        To get me through it all
        I let my guard down
        And then you pulled the rug
        I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
        This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

        Tell me somethin', girl
        Are you happy in this modern world?
        Or do you need more?
        Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
        I'm fallin'
        In all the good times I find myself longin' for change
        And in the bad times, I fear myself

        Tell me something, boy
        Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
        Or do you need more?
        Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

        I've been having dreams
        Jumping on a trampoline
        Flipping in the air
        I never land, just float there

        As I'm looking up
        Suddenly the sky erupts
        Flames alight the trees
        Spread to falling leaves
        Now they're right upon me

        Wait, if I'm on fire
        How am I so deep in love?
        When I dream of dying
        I never feel so loved

        Got you a Bullet and koozie

        Used to spend my nights out in a bar room
        Liquor was the only love I've known
        But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
        And brought me back from being too far gone

        You're as smooth
        As Tennessee whiskey
        You're as sweet
        As strawberry wine
        You're as warm
        As a glass of brandy
        And honey, I stay stoned on your love
        All the time

        I've looked for love in all the same old places

        Hey homecoming queen
        Why do you lie?
        When somebody's mean where do you hide?
        Do people assume you're always alright?
        Been so good at smiling most of your life

        Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
        Dancing with your best foot forward
        Does it get hard
        To have to play the part?
        Nobody's feeling sorry for you

        But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
        If you started showing what's under your skin
        What if you let them all in on the lie

        I've had a largemouth, bass bust my line
        A couple of beautiful girls tell me goodbye
        Trucks break down, dogs run off
        Politicians lie, gettin' fired by the boss
        It takes one hand to count the things I can count on
        No, there ain't much man that ain't ever let me down

        Longneck, iced cold beer never broke my heart
        Like diamond rings
        And football teams
        Have torn this boy apart
        Like a neon dream
        It just don't know me
        The bars and this guitar

        Are you disappointed?
        Are you desperate for help?
        You know what it's like to be tired
        And only a shell of yourself
        Well you start to believe
        You don't have what it takes
        'Cause it's all you can do
        Just to move, much less finish the race

        But don't forget what lies ahead

        Almost home
        Brother it won't be long
        Soon all your burdens will be gone
        With all your strength
        Sister run wild run free
        Hold up your head
        Keep pressing on
        We are almost home

        Well this road will be hard

        fell by the wayside, like everyone else\nI hate you, I hate you, I hate you\nBut

        that they''re gone\nAll I hear are the words that I needed to say\n\nWhen
        you hurt under the surface\nLike troubled water running cold\nWell, time can
        heal but this won''t\n\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could''ve
        said\nTo make your heartbeat better?\nIf only I''d have known you were the
        storm to weather\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could''ve said\nTo
        make it all stop hurting?\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial

        I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
        But I was just kidding myself
        Our every moment, I start to replace
        'Cause now that they're gone
        All I hear are the words that I needed to say

        When you hurt under the surface
        Like troubled water running cold
        Well, time can heal but this won't

        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make your heartbeat better?
        If only I'd have known you were the storm to weather
        So, before you go
        Was there something I could've said
        To make it all stop hurting?
