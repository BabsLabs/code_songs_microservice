        We couldn't turn around
        'Til we were upside down
        I'll be the bad guy now
        But no, I ain't too proud

        I couldn't be there
        Even when I try
        You don't believe it
        We do this every time

        Seasons change and our love went cold
        Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
        Run away, but we're running in circles
        Run away, run away
        I dare you to do something
        I'm waiting on you again
        So I don't take the blame

        I just hate all the hurt that you put me through
        And that I blame myself for letting you
        Did you know I already knew?

        Couldn't even see you through the smoke
        Looking back I probably should have known
        But I just wanted to believe that you were out sleeping alone

        Loved me with your worst intentions
        Didn't even stop to question
        Everytime you burned me down
        Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven

        Loved me with your worst intentions
        Painted us a happy ending
        Everytime you burned me down
        Don't know how for a moment it felt like heaven
        And it's so gut wrenching
        Falling in the wrong direction

        Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
        Wooh

        I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% that bitch
        Even when I'm crying crazy
        Yeah, I got boy problems, that's the human in me
        Bling bling, then I solve 'em, that's the goddess in me
        You coulda had a bad bitch, non-committal
        Help you with your career, just a little
        You're supposed to hold me down
        But you're holding me back
        And that's the sound of me not calling you back

        Why men great 'til they gotta be great?
        Don't text me, tell it straight to my face
        Best friend sat me down in the salon chair
        Shampoo press, get you out of my hair
        Fresh photos with the bomb lighting
        New man on the Minnesota Vikings
        Truth hurts, needed something more exciting
        Bom bom bi bom bi dum dum, ay

        Hold on, hold on

        시린 겨울바람
        깊은 발자국 아래 홀로 피어나
        내가 태어나고
        널 만난 이유를 찾아서 헤매어

        하얗게 번지는 한숨은
        얼어붙은 눈물
        버려진 꿈들은 다른 상처를 낳고
        이 계절의 끝이 어딜까
        영원이 있다면
        Hold on, hold on, hold on

        I will take it away before you stumble (Hold on, hold on)
        I will stay by your side until you survive (Hold on, hold on)
        피어나 주기를

        난 왜 널 만난 걸까
        하필 바로 지금 여기 이 겨울날

        You know everybody been waiting on that Baby, man
        I mean, it's like ever since Baby on Baby dropped
        Man, like, you know (Ever since Baby on Baby dropped)
        Ain't nobody drop shit (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
        Let's go, hah

        I needed some shit with some bop in it (Let's go)
        I flew past the whip with that blunt in my mouth
        Watch the swervin', that whip had a cop in it (Woo)
        My bitch got good pussy, fly her 'cross the country

        I finish the show and I hop in it
        I got me a milli', I did it legit-ly
        I'm still with the shits, I'm a hot nigga (Hot)

        Oh, you asking for pictures with niggas? (Huh?)
        What's your name? Get the fuck out the spot, nigga (Get the fuck)
        Tryna figure which deal I'ma take (Uh-huh)
        I woke up, couple mil' on my plate (Let's eat)

        I'm investing in real and estate (Uh-huh)
        I just went gave my mama a hundred (A hundred)
        Probably won't hear me open my mouth 'less you
        Hearin' me talkin' 'bout finding some money (Let's go)

        As soon as I found it, I flipped that (Flip)
        I'm a little bit different, they get it (They dig)
        Know I'm stiff on a bitch and she dig it
        Tryna find out why Baby ain't all in her mentions (Hah)

        No, she ain't get no DM from me (Bitch)

        I never land, just float there

        Suddenly the sky erupts

        Spread to falling leaves
        Now they're right upon me

        Hey homecoming queen
        Why do you lie?
        When somebody's mean where do you hide?
        Do people assume you're always alright?
        Been so good at smiling most of your life

        Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
        Dancing with your best foot forward
        Does it get hard
        To have to play the part?
        Nobody's feeling sorry for you

        But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
        If you started showing what's under your skin
        What if you let them all in on the lie

        Think about it, there must be a Higher Love
        Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
        Without it, life is wasted time
        Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine

        Things look so bad everywhere
        In this whole world, what is fair?
        We walk the line and try to see
        Falling behind in what could be, oh

        Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

        Can I go where you go?

        And ah, take me out, and take me home
        You're my, my, my, my

        Pictures of when we were young
        Would hang on the wall

        We would sit on the stoop
