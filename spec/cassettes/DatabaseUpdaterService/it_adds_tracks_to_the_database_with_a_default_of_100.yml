        I tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick ride
        Leave it to the double thick thighs, twin sisters
        Drop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted up
        She get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money up
        Slide, slide in the Bentley trucker, the Wraith trucker
        Your bestie is a dick sucker, I big dub her
        As-salama-lama alaykum, you big hater
        You nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser

        Now we catch him at the chicken spot, up a couple chops
        Pop that nigga with a hundred shots, ra-ta-ta-ta-ta
        DeDe made that nigga Diddy Bop, cha-cha-cha-cha-cha
        He thought we was gon' knuckle up, bitch, I don't box

        Woo, woo
        I pull up like
        How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh, oh, oh)
        How you pull up? I pull up (woo, Seth in the kitchen)

        Let's go
        Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
        With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
        This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
        My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
        You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
        Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
        And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

        It's safe to say I earned it
        Ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
        I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
        Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay"
        Don't make me push the button
        Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket

        Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
        I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
        I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
        Just talked to my mama

        just for me\nAnd I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees\nI

        You know there's a light that glows by the front door
        Don't forget the key's under the mat
        When childhood stars shine
        Always stay humble and kind

        Go to church 'cause your mamma says to
        Visit grandpa every chance that you can
        It won't be wasted time
        Always stay humble and kind

        Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie
        I know you got mountains to climb
        But always stay humble and kind

        You say I spend too much time in my head and it holds me back

        I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
        I'll get you up and going out of bed

        Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep
        I don't wanna pass away
        I've been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
        I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
        I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect

        I've been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
        When I leave this earth, hoping you'll find someone else
        'Cause, yeah, we're still young, there's so much we haven't done
        Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son

        I wish it could be me, but I won't make it off this bed
        I hope I go to heaven, so I see you once again
        My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
        Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

        Don't stay away for too long

        Yeah, baby

        Out here ain't nothing but woods and water
        Drop a deer from a stand, catch a fish with a bobber
        Drink a beer out the can, liquor out the bottle
        How the good Lord intended it, yes he did

        I love my country
        I love my country
        Six strings and fiddles
        Whiskey from Kentucky

        We keep it funky
        We like how it sounds
        Monday to Sunday
        Yeah, I love my country

        I'm loud and proud
        Rolling into town
        Hanging out the window
        Like a blue tick hound

        Ain't sorry, ain't nothing to be sorry about
        I love my country and I love my country
        Up loud

        I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
        Had to love and lose a hundred million times
        Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
        Now I'm falling

        You say my name like I have never heard before
        I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
        I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
        Are you falling?

        Center of attention
        You know you can get whatever you want from me
        Whenever you want it, baby
        It's you in my reflection
        I'm afraid of all the things you could do to me
        If I would've known it, baby

        I would've stayed at home
        'Cause I was doing better alone
        But when you said, hello
        I knew that was the end of it all

        This shit's so good, should be illegal
        Need round two, I need a sequel
        Hit the backboard like a free throw
        You next level, you a cheat code
        In so deep, you hit my seafloor

        Got me singing like Alicia
        Got me using all your lingo
        Tell your girlfriend that you single
        Call me over 'cause I go hard

        Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
        Next day, act just like your road dog
        Bitches askin' how you know her
        Head game stupid, baby loca
        Too loud, callate la boca
        Out this world, you supernova
        Fuck that, I am coming over

        Can I come over?
        (Can) Can I (I) stop by (Stop by) to see you (See you) tonight?
        Can I stop by to see you? (Tonight)

        Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
        When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
        What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
        Do you think of me?

        When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
        Everything, I wanna know it all

        I'd spend 10,000 hours and 10,000 more
        Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
        And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
        If it's 10,000 hours or the rest of my life
        I'm gonna love you

        Do you miss the road that you grew up on?

        I read a note my grandma wrote
        Back in 1923
        Grandpa kept it in his coat

        And he showed it once to me
        He said
        Boy you might not understand, but a long long time ago
        Grandma's daddy didn't like me none

        But I loved your grandma so
        We had this crazy plan to meet
        And run away together
        Get married in the first town we came to and live forever

        But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead
        I found this letter
        And this is what it said:

        I've been thinking 'bout time
        And where does it go
        How can I stop my life from passing me by, I don't know
        I've been thinking 'bout family and how it's going so fast
        Will I wake up one morning just wishing that I could go back
        I've been thinking 'bout lately, maybe
        I can make a change and let you change me
        So, with all of my heart this is my prayer

        Singing oh Lord, keep me in the moment
        Help me live with my eyes wide open
        'Cause I don't wanna miss what you have for me
        Singing oh Lord, show me what matters
        Throw away what I'm chasing after
        'Cause I don't wanna miss what you have for me
        Keep me in the moment
        Oh, keep me in the moment
        Keep me in the moment
