        Woo child, tired of the bullshit
        Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
        Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
        In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
        Come now, come dry your eyes
        You know you a star, you can touch the sky
        I know that it's hard but you have to try
        If you need advice, let me simplify

        If he don't love you anymore
        Just walk your fine ass out the door

        left me at all, so\n\nIf you don''t wanna see me dancing with somebody\nIf

        I'm all good already
        So moved on, it's scary
        I'm not where you left me at all, so

        If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
        If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

        Don't show up
        Don't come out
        Don't start caring about me now
        Walk away, you know how

        Nobody's singing a harmony
        Up there just me and my shadow
        No base, no guitar, no tambourine

        And I found you like a melody
        You were singing in the same key as me
        We had 'em dancing in the streets

        I don't wanna be a one man band
        I don't wanna be a rolling stone alone

        you, and you, and you\nI hate your friends and they hate me, too\nI''m through,
        I''m through, I''m through\nThis that hot girl bummer anthem\nTurn it up and
        throw a tantrum\n\nThis that hot girl bummer anthem\nTurn it up and throw
        a tantrum\nThis that throw up in your Birkin bag\nAn'' hook up with someone
        random\nThis that social awkward suicide\nThat bite your lips and buy your
        likes\nI swear she had a man\nBut shit hit different when it''s Thursday night\n\nThat
        college dropout music\nEvery day leg day, she be too thick\nAnd my friends
        are all annoying\nBut we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid\nThis that 10K on the
        table just so we can be secluded\nAnd the vodka came diluted\nOne more line,
        I''m superhuman\n\nFuck you, and you, and you\nI hate your friends and they
        hate me, too\nI''m through, I''m through, I''m through\nThis that hot girl

        Some look for trouble while others don't
        There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day

        You're not a voice
        You're just a ringing in my ear
        And if I heard you, which I don't
        I'm spoken for I fear

        Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
        I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
        I've had my adventure, I don't need something new

        I wish girls you love never gave back diamond rings
        I wish every porch had a swing

        I wish every state had a Birmingham

        I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
        I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

        And I wish even cars had truck beds
        And every road was named Copperhead
        And coolers never ran out of cold Bud Light
        And I wish high school home teams never lost
        And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
        I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
        I wish honkytonks didn't have no closing time
        And I wish grandpas never died

        We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
        This is our place, we make the rules
        And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
        Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

        Can I go where you go?
        Can we always be this close forever and ever?
        And ah, take me out, and take me home

        We could let our friends crash in the living room
        This is our place, we make the call

        Hold on, hold on
        Hold on, hold on

        시린 겨울바람
        깊은 발자국 아래 홀로 피어나
        내가 태어나고
        널 만난 이유를 찾아서 헤매어

        하얗게 번지는 한숨은
        얼어붙은 눈물
        버려진 꿈들은 다른 상처를 낳고
        이 계절의 끝이 어딜까
        영원이 있다면
        Hold on, hold on, hold on

        I will take it away before you stumble (Hold on, hold on)
        I will stay by your side until you survive (Hold on, hold on)
        피어나 주기를

        난 왜 널 만난 걸까
        하필 바로 지금 여기 이 겨울날
        눈 감으면 봄은 아득하고

        We are, we are, we are

        L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
        Sundown and they all come out
        Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
        The party's on, so they're headin' downtown

        Everybody's lookin' for a come up
        And they wanna know what you're about
        Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
        We're just tryna figure everything out

        We don't fit in well
        'Cause we are just ourselves
        I could use some help
        Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

        You look stunning, dear
        So don't ask that question here
        This is my only fear, that we become (hey)
        Beautiful people

        Drop top, designer clothes
        Front row at fashion shows
        "What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
        Inside the world of beautiful people

        goodnight\nAll those little moments are every reason why\n\nI''m homesick\nThis
        feeling that I''m feeling\nNo, we don''t quit\nIt''s like half of me is missing\nHeaven
        knows it that all I wanna do\n\nIs be alone with your brown eyes all tangled
        up\nJust holdin'' onto you tonight\nUntil the morning\nBaby that''s the damn
        truth\nIf home is where the heart is\nI''m homesick for you\n...\n\n*******

        Heartless (Heartless, heartless)
        So heartless (So heartless, so heartless)

        Say you're going out late
        I count down 'til you call me
        It's just one of those things
        That you do when you're lonely
        And you're all about the chase
        But you won't ever let me catch you
        And I wish I was the same

        But I know I'm gonna let you win again and when I do
        It's gonna hurt like hell and you don't mean to
        That's what I tell myself

        But, why you gotta be so heartless?
        I know you think it's harmless
        You're tearing me apart and
        Girl the hardest part is
        You're so high on attention
        Taking miles from inches
        Leave me in the darkness
        Never finished what we started
        Girl why you gotta be so heartless?
        (So heartless, so heartless)
        Why you gotta be so heartless?

        Hey homecoming queen
        Why do you lie?
        When somebody's mean where do you hide?
        Do people assume you're always alright?
        Been so good at smiling most of your life

        Look damn good in the dress, zipping up the mess
        Dancing with your best foot forward
        Does it get hard
        To have to play the part?
        Nobody's feeling sorry for you

        But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
        If you started showing what's under your skin
        What if you let them all in on the lie

        I've been watching you for some time
        Can't stop starin' at those ocean eyes
        Burning cities and napalm skies

        Your ocean eyes

        When you give me those ocean eyes
        I'm scared

        Think about it, there must be a Higher Love
        Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
        Without it, life is wasted time
        Look inside your heart, and I'll look inside mine

        Things look so bad everywhere
        In this whole world, what is fair?

        Suicidal

        Lately I've been feeling suicidal
        Your love is suicidal

        I thought that we were meant to be
        You took my heart and made it bleed
        I gave you all my ecstasy
        I know you'll be the death of me
        Left lipstick on my Hennessy
        Felt like you took my soul from me
        You gave me all your ecstasy
        I thought that we were meant to be

        Your love is suicidal
        For me, your love is suicidal
        To me, your love is suicidal
        To me, your love is suicidal

        I'm sippin' Hennessy-'y-'y, ooh

        Hey
        Yeah?
        Tell 'em that story you were telling me
        Couple boys clock out about 5:35

        Tryna' put a little hammer in their head
        Standing in the liquor store staring at a 5th
        But they picked up a handle instead
        Hell right, hell right

        Hell right (Okay)
        Couple girls with their boots on
        Got their bluetooth on
        T-shirt saying 'Go Sinners'

        Then the girl from the small town
        Took off the old town
        Put on a little Hank junior (Thank God)
        Hell right
        She got all her rowdy friends coming over tonight

        Hell right, hell right
        Everybody's throwing down on a Friday night
        Somewhere in America
